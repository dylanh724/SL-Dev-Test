Smartlaunch Developer Coding Test


General Test Info

- Spend max 8 hours on the task. This is important, simply so we can assure that you will be able to deliver quickly enough. 
- You can decide when to spend the 8 hours to do the task, and you can also split it into several sessions, and we encourage you to do it at home. Just keep track of your time usage.
- Don't worry about UI. Focus on the code.
- Don't worry about pretty code. What we want to see is code that works. We do not mind if it looks weird.
- Use code from existing open source projects if possible. For almost all tasks today you can find ready made code on e.g. Code Project. Use it. It will save you a lot of time.

Test Description

Build a simple WinForms VB.NET desktop app, which can connect to a simple web service and allow a user to create an account and login.

Webservice Details

- Should use MSSQL Express/Server (which ever choice is the easiest for you to get started quickly)
- Have two functions: 1) where user can register and 2) where user can sign-up
User register form should have the following fields:
- Username
- Password
- Firstname
- Lastname
- Mobile phone number
- Email
- Birthday

Desktop App Details

- The app needs a main window, with a login form and a "Register" link
- Login form should just call webservice and ask if username and password is correct
- Register link, shows a new window, where the user can type in the information listed above (username, password, name etc.)

Bonus Tasks

- If you have more time (within the 8 hours), complete as many as possible of the following tasks.
- Register/sign-up form should check if username, email or phone number already exists (needs a new webservice function to check this)
- Forgot password link (should ask for email in pop-up and send out an email to the user)
- Send registration email to user, with a activation code (4 digit number), when the user has to enter in the sign-up process to complete registration.
- Note, we do not expect that you will be able to complete all of the above in just 8 hours. Just finish as much as you can, even if the code is not working fully and has a few small bugs.

Please Ask No Questions - Improvise!

- Another part of the exercise, is to test how well you can think on your own, when you have very limited information.
- So if you have any questions, ask yourself what you would have done, and do that.
- This is very important, as you will be given a lot of responsibility with this job.

Delivery

- Please zip and email the source code as a VB.NET project to Edwin Krisnha: ek@smartlaunch.com, and cc Mike Ziarko mz@smartlaunch.com
- Please send it before Wednesday, 10 September 2014 (and still spend max 8 hours in total)

I hope you like the little challenge :)

Of course, if you have any non-technical questions, you are always welcome to Edwin or Mike.
 
Good luck!
